Modes

1. OFF Mode
Rapid fire completely disabled.
Normal controller operation.
Automatically activates after ~5 minutes of inactivity.

2. Continuous Mode (Custom SPS)
Holds rapid fire as long as you keep R2 pressed.
Custom SPS (Shots Per Second): Adjustable from 1 to 40 (recommended 4–30 for best stability and game compatibility).
Ideal for automatic weapons, sustained fire, etc.

3. Burst Mode (Custom Shots)
Fires a precise number of shots with each trigger pull.
Custom Burst Count: Adjustable from 1 to 50 shots.
Perfect for semi-auto weapons or controlled bursts (e.g. 3–5 shots).

All Features Explained

Calibration (Very Important!)
Manual Calibration:
Cal Released (trigger not pressed)
Cal Pressed (trigger fully pressed)
Apply Manual Cal
Reset Calibration → Restores safe default values.
Good calibration = reliable trigger detection.

Advanced Settings

Jitter (0-100%)
Adds small random variations to firing timing. Makes it harder to detect and feels more natural. Recommended: 10-20%. Use this on online play for less risk of getting banned.

Hysteresis (0-100%)
Creates a "dead zone" around the trigger threshold to prevent rapid on/off chatter. Recommended: 10-15%.

Debounce (0-500ms)
Ignores very quick or noisy trigger changes. Recommended: 40-60ms.

Press Percent (0-100%)
How far you need to press the trigger to activate firing. Recommended: 90-95%.

Pulse Width (5-200ms)
Duration of each individual "press" signal.
Lower values = better for high SPS.
Recommended: 25-40ms.

Polarity
Decreasing (Default)
Increasing


Global Buttons

Turn OFF

Reset Trigger State – Fixes stuck or weird behavior

Auto Fix – Quickly applies safer debounce + hysteresis values


Best Practices & Tips

Always start with Calibration.

30 SPS is an excellent sweet spot — very stable and effective.

For higher SPS (35+), reduce Pulse Width to 5-10ms.

Use moderate jitter for a more human-like feel.
If the mod feels

inconsistent, recalibrate and use Reset Trigger State.

Troubleshooting

No firing / wrong detection → Recalibrate
Choppy or stuck firing → Reset Trigger State or power cycle

SPS not stable → Lower SPS slightly or reduce Pulse Width

Too sensitive → Increase Debounce and Hysteresis

Enjoy the mod!

This version is highly optimized for reliability and ease of use. Feel free to share your results, settings, or suggestions.
